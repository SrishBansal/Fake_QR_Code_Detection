## Project Title

Enthuse : A Fake_QR_Code_Detection Software


## Project Description    


We developed a deeplearning model that can effectively distinguish between legitimate QR codes and those embedded with malicious content, such as viruses or phishing links. We trained a deep
learning model to distinguish between real QR codes and fake QR code.

## Inspiration behind the Project  


The reason I chose this idea/project was the rise in fraud through malicious QRcodes embedding viruses or phishing links.

## Tech Stack    
_Technologies/methods/platforms we used to build our project_


The technologies I used TensorFlow, MobileNet v2, Pandas, Numpy, OpenCV, Pytorch
