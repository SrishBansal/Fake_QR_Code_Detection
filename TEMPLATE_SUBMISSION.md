Enthuse : A Fake_QR_Code_Detection Software


## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_


We developed a deeplearning model that can effectively distinguish betweenlegitimate QR codes and thoseembedded with malicious content, such as viruses orphishing links. We trained a deep
learning model to distinguish between real QR codes and fake QR code.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_


The reason I chose this idea/project was the rise in fraud through malicious QRcodes embedding viruses or phishing links.
